## Presentations

**Please be aware that only 4 co-presenters or 3 co-presenters and 1 shared screen will be visible and audible at any one time.** If you have 4 people on screen and would like to invite up an additional person, one of the current presenters will need to leave. The host may click the x above the speaker to remove them from the screen (they will still be an audience member and can be invited back on screen at any time.)
