## More about CarpentryCon @ Home:

We canâ€™t meet in person for CarpentryCon 2020, so weâ€™re bringing CarpentryCon to you! CarpentryCon @ Home is an online series of events happening in July and August, sharing some of the great content that was planned for CarpentryCon 2020 in Madison, WI including keynotes, breakouts, lightning talks, and socialising.

### What are the different kinds of sessions that can be proposed?

We have listed a few ideas of session types that include breakout discussion, skill-up, social event, informal meetup, panel session, resource development sprint or other. 
We encourage designing a proposal that invites and welcomes participation from a diverse community of learner, educators, instructors, maintainers, researchers, developers, artists, and other stakeholders online.

Because we would like to make sessions available for those who cannot attend, please indicate if there is the possibility to record a video from the session and/or create a blog post summary.

See the definition of each event below:

* **Breakout discussion**: These sessions are 1.5 hours long and conducted in a round table or general discussion format. They will play a crucial role in connecting the participants based on their common interests and stimulate discussion on the relevant topics. A few examples of the breakout sessions from CarpentryCon Dublin 2018: Chasing Funding for Workshops and The Carpentries Membership, How Can We Develop New Curricula and Contribute to Existing Lessons, Incubating a New Carpentry, Mentoring, etc. 

* **Skill-up workshops**: A workshop is a way for you to pass on your ideas and expertise to other participants in a 1.5 - 2 hours long session. You can reach out to a larger numbers of people by conducting a workshop on the topic that you find important and facilitate a positive learning environment for the attendees. It can also be a training workshop that will allow participants to develop new skills. A few examples of the workshops from the CarpentryCon 2018 are: Ally workshop, Bring and Build Your Own Lesson 'Carpentries-style', Next Steps in R, Library Carpentry On-Boarding, Project Leadership, Speaking Effectively, Contributing on GitHub, Leading a Research Lab, Shell Tips and Tricks, etc.

* **Panel session**: A panel discussions will be 1-1.5 hour long live discussions about a specific topic amongst a selected group of panelists who share differing perspectives. The proposal author or suggested lead will moderate and guides the panel and the audience through the event. Panelists are ideally 3-4 experts in the field, who will shares ideas, evidences/studies, and opinions, and address questions from the audience either curated by the moderator or asked by the attendees.

* **Social event and informal meetups**: These could be 1-2 hour long social calls to network with the community members over certain theme or format. For example, themed pub quiz, informal discussions on community, data science, teaching, creative writing, knitting, cross stitching, yoga, meditation, self care, virtual museum tour, storytelling etc.

* **Lesson or resource development sprint**: This can be 1 day - 1 month long collaborative effort to develop lesson to resources relevant to The Carpentries community. 

* **Other**: If none of these sessions fits your idea, please use the "other" option.
